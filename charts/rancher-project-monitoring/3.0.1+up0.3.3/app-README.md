# Rancher Project Monitoring and Alerting

The chart installs a Project Monitoring Stack, which contains:
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (managed externally by [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) (managed externally by [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- [Grafana](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana) (deployed via an embedded Helm chart)
- Default PrometheusRules and Grafana dashboards based on the collection of community-curated resources from [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/)
- Default ServiceMonitors that watch the deployed resources

Note: This chart is not intended for standalone use; it's intended to be deployed via [Prometheus Federator](https://github.com/rancher/prometheus-federator).
