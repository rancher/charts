# Prometheus Federator

This chart deploys an operator that manages Project Monitoring Stacks composed of the following set of resources that are scoped to project namespaces:
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (managed externally by [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) (managed externally by [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- [Grafana](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana) (deployed via an embedded Helm chart)
- Default PrometheusRules and Grafana dashboards based on the collection of community-curated resources from [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/)
- Default ServiceMonitors that watch the deployed Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager

Since this Project Monitoring Stack deploys Prometheus Operator CRs, an existing Prometheus Operator instance must already be deployed in the cluster for Prometheus Federator to successfully be able to deploy Project Monitoring Stacks. It is recommended to use [`rancher-monitoring`](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/monitoring-alerting/) for this. For more information on how the chart works or advanced configurations, please read the `README.md`.
