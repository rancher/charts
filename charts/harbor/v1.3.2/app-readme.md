# Harbor - Cloud Native Repository for Kubernetes

[Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) is an open source container image registry that secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. As a CNCF Incubating project, Harbor delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage images across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

This [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) chart installs [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) in a Kubernetes cluster.
