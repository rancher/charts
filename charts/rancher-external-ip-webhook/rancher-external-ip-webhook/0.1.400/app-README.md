# externalip-webhook

This chart was created to mitigate [CVE-2020-8554](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-8554/)

External IP Webhook is a validating k8s webhook which prevents services from using random external IPs. Cluster administrators
can specify list of CIDRs allowed to be used as external IP by specifying `allowed-external-ip-cidrs` parameter. 
The webhook will only allow services which either donâ€™t set external IP, or whose external IPs are within the range specified by the administrator.

For more information, review the Helm README of this chart.
