Rancher Logging, powered by the [Bonzai Logging Operator](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/), allows users to configure complex logging pipelines with a few simple resources.
To collect logs from a single namespace, users can create an [Output](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/crds/v1beta1/output_types/) to define where logs are stored and a corresponding [Flow](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/crds/v1beta1/flow_types/) to describe what logs to include and what outputs to send to.
To collect logs from the entire cluster, users can similarly create a [ClusterOutput](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/crds/v1beta1/clusteroutput_types/) and a corresponding [ClusterFlow](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/crds/v1beta1/clusterflow_types/).
