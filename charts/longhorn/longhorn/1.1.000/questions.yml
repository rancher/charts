    description: "Allow Longhorn Instance Managers to have guaranteed CPU allocation. By default 0.25. The value is how many CPUs should be reserved for each Engine/Replica Instance Manager Pod created by Longhorn. For example, 0.1 means one-tenth of a CPU. This will help maintain engine stability during high node workload. It only applies to the Engine/Replica Instance Manager Pods created after the setting took effect.
In order to prevent unexpected volume crash, you can use the following formula to calculate an appropriate value for this setting:
'Guaranteed Engine CPU = The estimated max Longhorn volume/replica count on a node * 0.1'.
The result of above calculation doesn't mean that's the maximum CPU resources the Longhorn workloads require. To fully exploit the Longhorn volume I/O performance, you can allocate/guarantee more CPU resources via this setting.
If it's hard to estimate the volume/replica count now, you can leave it with the default value, or allocate 1/8 of total CPU of a node. Then you can tune it when there is no running workload using Longhorn volumes.

    description: "To dedicate nodes to store Longhorn replicas and reject other general workloads, set tolerations for Longhorn and add taints for the storage nodes.
All Longhorn volumes should be detached before modifying toleration settings.
We recommend setting tolerations during Longhorn deployment because the Longhorn system cannot be operated during the update.
Multiple tolerations can be set here, and these tolerations are separated by semicolon. For example:
* `key1=value1:NoSchedule; key2:NoExecute`
* `:` this toleration tolerates everything because an empty key with operator `Exists` matches all keys, values and effects
* `key1=value1:`  this toleration has empty effect. It matches all effects with key `key1`
Because `kubernetes.io` is used as the key of all Kubernetes default tolerations, it should not be used in the toleration settings.
