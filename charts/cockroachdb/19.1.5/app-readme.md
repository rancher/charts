# CockroachDB Chart

CockroachDB is a Distributed SQL database that runs natively in Kubernetes. It gives you resilient, horizontal scale across multiple clouds with always-on availability and data partitioned by location.

CockroachDB scales horizontally without reconfiguration or need for a massive architectural overhaul. Simply add a new node to the cluster and CockroachDB takes care of the underlying complexity.

    - Scale by simply adding new nodes to a CockroachDB cluster
    - Automate balancing and distribution of ranges, not shards
    - Optimize server utilization evenly across all nodes
