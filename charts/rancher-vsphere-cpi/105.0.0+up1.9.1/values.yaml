# A list of Semver constraint strings (defined by https://github.com/Masterminds/semver) and values.yaml overrides.
#
# For each key in versionOverrides, this chart will check to see if the current Kubernetes cluster's version matches
# any of the semver constraints provided as keys on the map.
#
# On seeing a match, the default value for each values.yaml field overridden will be updated with the new value.
#
# If multiple matches are encountered (due to overlapping semver ranges), the matches will be applied in order.
#
# Notes:
# - On running a helm template, Helm uses the `.Capabilities.APIVersion` of whatever
#   Kubernetes release that version of Helm was built against.
# - On running a helm install --dry-run, the correct kubeVersion should be chosen.
#
# Supported versions can be found at:
# https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere#compatibility-with-kubernetes
