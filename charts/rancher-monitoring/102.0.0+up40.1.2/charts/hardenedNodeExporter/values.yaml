# A list of Semver constraint strings (defined by https://github.com/Masterminds/semver) and values.yaml overrides.
#
# For each key in kubeVersionOverrides, this chart will check to see if the current Kubernetes cluster's version matches
# any of the semver constraints provided as keys on the map.
#
# On seeing a match, the default value for each values.yaml field overridden will be updated with the new value.
#
# If multiple matches are encountered (due to overlapping semver ranges), the matches will be applied in order.
#
# Notes:
# - On running a helm template, Helm generally assumes the kubeVersion is v1.20.0
# - On running a helm install --dry-run, the correct kubeVersion should be chosen.

  # The default intention of rancher-pushprox clients is to scrape hostNetwork metrics across all nodes.
  # This can be used to scrape internal Kubernetes components or DaemonSets of hostNetwork Pods in
  # situations where a cloud provider firewall prevents Pod-To-Host communication but not Pod-To-Pod.
  # However, if the underlying hostNetwork Pod that is being scraped is managed by a Deployment,
  # this advanced option enables users to deploy the client as a Deployment instead of a DaemonSet.
  # If a user deploys this feature and the underlying Deployment's number of replicas changes, the user will
  # be responsible for upgrading this chart accordingly to the right number of replicas.
