# Changelog
All notable changes from the upstream Prometheus Operator chart will be added to this file.

## [Package Version 00] - 2020-07-19
### Added
- Added [Prometheus Adapter](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-adapter) as a dependency to the upstream Prometheus Operator chart to allow users to expose custom metrics from the default Prometheus instance deployed by this chart
- Remove `prometheus-operator/cleanup-crds.yaml` and `prometheus-operator/crds.yaml` from the Prometheus Operator upstream chart in favor of just using the CRD directory to install the CRDs.
- Added support for `rkeControllerManager`, `rkeScheduler`, `rkeProxy`, and `rkeEtcd` PushProx exporters for monitoring k8s components within RKE clusters
- Added support for a `k3sServer` PushProx exporter that monitors k3s server components (`kubeControllerManager`, `kubeScheduler`, and `kubeProxy`) within k3s clusters
- Added support for `kubeAdmControllerManager`, `kubeAdmScheduler`, `kubeAdmProxy`, and `kubeAdmEtcd` PushProx exporters for monitoring k8s components within kubeAdm clusters
- Added support for `rke2ControllerManager`, `rke2Scheduler`, `rke2Proxy`, and `rke2Etcd` PushProx exporters for monitoring k8s components within rke2 clusters
- Exposed `prometheus.prometheusSpec.ignoreNamespaceSelectors` on values.yaml and set it to `false` by default. This value instructs the default Prometheus server deployed with this chart to ignore the `namespaceSelector` field within any created ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor CRs that it selects. This prevents ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors from configuring the Prometheus scrape configuration to monitor resources outside the namespace that they are deployed in; if a user needs to have one ServiceMonitor / PodMonitor monitor resources within several namespaces (such as the resources that are used to monitor Istio in a default installation), they should not enable this option since it would require them to create one ServiceMonitor / PodMonitor CR per namespace that they would like to monitor. Relevant fields were also updated in the default README.md.
- Added `grafana.sidecar.dashboards.searchNamespace` to `values.yaml` with a default value of `cattle-dashboards`. The namespace provided should contain all ConfigMaps with the label `grafana_dashboard` and will be searched by the Grafana Dashboards sidecar for updates. The namespace specified is also created along with this deployment. All default dashboard ConfigMaps have been relocated from the deployment namespace to the namespace specified
- Added `monitoring-admin`, `monitoring-edit`, and `monitoring-view` default `ClusterRoles` to allow admins to assign roles to users to interact with Prometheus Operator CRs. These can be enabled by setting `.Values.global.rbac.userRoles.create` (default: `true`). In a typical RBAC setup, you might want to use a `ClusterRoleBinding` to bind these roles to a Subject to allow them to set up or view `ServiceMonitors` / `PodMonitors` / `PrometheusRules` and view `Prometheus` or `Alertmanager` CRs across the cluster. If `.Values.global.rbac.userRoles.aggregateRolesForRBAC` is enabled, these ClusterRoles will aggregate into the respective default ClusterRoles provided by Kubernetes
- Added `monitoring-config-admin`, `monitoring-config-edit` and `monitoring-config-view` default `Roles` to allow admins to assign roles to users to be able to edit / view `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps` within the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace. These can be enabled by setting `.Values.global.rbac.userRoles.create` (default: `true`). In a typical RBAC setup, you might want to use a `RoleBinding` to bind these roles to a Subject within the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace to allow them to modify Secrets / ConfigMaps tied to the deployment, such as your Alertmanager Config Secret. 
- Added `monitoring-dashboard-admin`, `monitoring-dashboard-edit` and `monitoring-dashboard-view` default `Roles` to allow admins to assign roles to users to be able to edit / view `ConfigMaps` within the `cattle-dashboards` namespace. These can be enabled by setting `.Values.global.rbac.userRoles.create` (default: `true`) and deploying Grafana as part of this chart. In a typical RBAC setup, you might want to use a `RoleBinding` to bind these roles to a Subject within the `cattle-dashboards` namespace to allow them to create / modify ConfigMaps that contain the JSON used to persist Grafana Dashboards on the cluster.
- Added default resource limits for `Prometheus Operator`, `Prometheus`, `AlertManager`, `Grafana`, `kube-state-metrics`, `node-exporter`
- Added a default template `rancher_defaults.tmpl` to AlertManager that Rancher will offer to users in order to help configure the way alerts are rendered on a notifier. Also updated the default template deployed with this chart to reference that template and added an example of a Slack config using this template as a comment in the `values.yaml`.
- Added support for private registries via introducing a new field for `global.cattle.systemDefaultRegistry` that, if supplied, will automatically be prepended onto every image used by the chart.
- Added a default `nginx` proxy container deployed with Grafana whose config is set in the `ConfigMap` located in `charts/grafana/templates/nginx-config.yaml`. The purpose of this container is to make it possible to view Grafana's UI through a proxy that has a subpath (e.g. Rancher's proxy). This proxy container is set to listen on port `8080` (with a `portName` of `nginx-http` instead of the default `service`), which is also where the Grafana service will now point to, and will forward all requests to the Grafana container listening on the default port `3000`.
- Added a default `nginx` proxy container deployed with Prometheus whose config is set in the `ConfigMap` located in `templates/prometheus/nginx-config.yaml`. The purpose of this container is to make it possible to view Prometheus's UI through a proxy that has a subpath (e.g. Rancher's proxy). This proxy container is set to listen on port `8080` (with a `portName` of `nginx-http` instead of the default `web`), which is also where the Prometheus service will now point to, and will forward all requests to the Prometheus container listening on the default port `9090`.
- Added support for passing CIS Scans in a hardened cluster by introducing a Job that patches the default service account within the `cattle-monitoring-system` and `cattle-dashboards` namespaces on install or upgrade and adding a default allow all `NetworkPolicy` to the `cattle-monitoring-system` and `cattle-dashboards` namespaces.
### Modified
- Updated the chart name from `prometheus-operator` to `rancher-monitoring` and added the `io.rancher.certified: rancher` annotation to `Chart.yaml`
- Modified the default `node-exporter` port from `9100` to `9796`
- Modified the default `nameOverride` to `rancher-monitoring`. This change is necessary as the Prometheus Adapter's default URL (`http://{{ .Values.nameOverride }}-prometheus.{{ .Values.namespaceOverride }}.svc`) is based off of the value used here; if modified, the default Adapter URL must also be modified
- Modified the default `namespaceOverride` to `cattle-monitoring-system`. This change is necessary as the Prometheus Adapter's default URL (`http://{{ .Values.nameOverride }}-prometheus.{{ .Values.namespaceOverride }}.svc`) is based off of the value used here; if modified, the default Adapter URL must also be modified
- Configured some default values for `grafana.service` values and exposed them in the default README.md
- The default namespaces the following ServiceMonitors were changed from the deployment namespace to allow them to continue to monitor metrics when `prometheus.prometheusSpec.ignoreNamespaceSelectors` is enabled:
    - `core-dns`: `kube-system`
    - `api-server`: `default`
    - `kube-controller-manager`: `kube-system`
    - `kubelet`: `{{ .Values.kubelet.namespace }}`
- Disabled the following deployments by default (can be enabled if required):
    - `AlertManager`
    - `kube-controller-manager` metrics exporter
    - `kube-etcd` metrics exporter
    - `kube-scheduler` metrics exporter
    - `kube-proxy` metrics exporter
- Updated default Grafana `deploymentStrategy` to `Recreate` to prevent deployments from being stuck on upgrade if a PV is attached to Grafana
- Modified the default `<serviceMonitor|podMonitor|rule>SelectorNilUsesHelmValues` to default to `false`. As a result, we look for all CRs with any labels in all namespaces by default rather than just the ones tagged with the label `release: rancher-monitoring`.
- Modified the default images used by the `rancher-monitoring` chart to point to Rancher mirrors of the original images from upstream.
- Modified the behavior of the chart to create the Alertmanager Config Secret via a pre-install hook instead of using the normal Helm lifecycle to manage the secret. The benefit of this approach is that all changes to the Config Secret done on a live cluster will never get overridden on a `helm upgrade` since the secret only gets created on a `helm install`. If you would like the secret to be cleaned up on an `helm uninstall`, enable `alertmanager.cleanupOnUninstall`; however, this is disabled by default to prevent the loss of alerting configuration on an uninstall. This secret will never be modified on a `helm upgrade`.
- Modified the default `securityContext` for `Pod` templates across the chart to `{"runAsNonRoot": "true", "runAsUser": "1000"}` and replaced `grafana.rbac.pspUseAppArmor` in favor of `grafana.rbac.pspAnnotations={}` in order to make it possible to deploy this chart on a hardened cluster which does not support Seccomp or AppArmor annotations in PSPs. Users can always choose to specify the annotations they want to use for the PSP directly as part of the values provided.
- Modified `.Values.prometheus.prometheusSpec.containers` to take in a string representing a template that should be rendered by Helm (via `tpl`) instead of allowing a user to provide YAML directly.
- Modified the default Grafana configuration to auto assign users who access Grafana to the Viewer role and enable anonymous access to Grafana dashboards by default. This default works well for a Rancher user who is accessing Grafana via the `kubectl proxy` on the Rancher Dashboard UI since anonymous users who enter via the proxy are authenticated by the k8s API Server, but you can / should modify this behavior if you plan on exposing Grafana in a way that does not require authentication (e.g. as a `NodePort` service).
- Modified the default Grafana configuration to add a default dashboard for Rancher on the Grafana home page.
