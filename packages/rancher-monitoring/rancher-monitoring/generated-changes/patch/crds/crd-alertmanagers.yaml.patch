+                        to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the
+                        pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed. \n Use this
+                        if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features
+                        of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
+                        tracking are needed, c) the storage driver is specified through
+                        a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic
+                        volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource
+                        for more information on the connection between this volume
+                        type and PersistentVolumeClaim). \n Use PersistentVolumeClaim
+                        or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist
+                        for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod. \n Use
+                        CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver
+                        is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the
+                        driver for more information. \n A pod can use both types of
+                        ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time."
