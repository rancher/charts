              - Ensure all container images have repository and tag on the same level to ensure that all container images are included in rancher-images.txt which are used by airgap customers.

              Ex:-
                longhorn-controller:
                  repository: rancher/hardened-sriov-cni
                  tag: v2.6.3-build20230913
              </pre>
              - Add a üëç (thumbs up) reaction to this comment once done. CI won't pass without this reaction to the github-action bot's latest validation comment.
              - Approve the PR to run the CI check.`
